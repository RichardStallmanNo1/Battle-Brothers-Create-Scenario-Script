# Battle-Brothers-Create-Scenario-Script

You can compile this by just making it through QB64. Feel free to edit or modify, doesn't matter to me. It's fairly limited.

Mostly just sets up backgrounds/levels. Doesn't set up items or anything fancy. Could but just doesn't at the moment, maybe another time.
